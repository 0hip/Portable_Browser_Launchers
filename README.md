# THORIUM-PORTABLE-LAUNCHER
Single CMD file to:
* Run Thorium Portable.
* Update (download and unzip) and run Thorium Portable. If THORIUM-PORTABLE-LAUNCHER is run from an empty folder, it will prompt for the release type you want: AVX2, AVX or SSE3.
* Check for updates every time THORIUM-PORTABLE-LAUNCHER is run

  (PD.I used it combined with chrlauncher (changing the CMD "start" to run chrlauncher instead of Thorium, then set up chrlauncher to run Thorium Portable) in order to take advantage of the chrlauncher's SETDEFAULTBROWSER ;)
