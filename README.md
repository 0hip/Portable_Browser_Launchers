# THORIUM-PORTABLE-LAUNCHER
Single CMD file to:
* Download and unzip Thorium Portable (unziped to the folder the CMD file is located). Will ask for the release type : AVX2, AVX or SSE3.
* Check for updates every time the CMD file is run (3 option: none, auto and ask_first Default: ask_first)
* Run Thorium Portable.

  (PD.I used it combined with chrlauncher (changing the CMD "start" to run chrlauncher instead of Thorium, then set up chrlauncher to run Thorium Portable) in order to take advantage of the chrlauncher's SET CHRLAUNCHER TO DEFAULT BROWSER ;)
